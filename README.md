# Zimri Leisher
I code rockets at Firefly Aerospace. My primary languages are C++, Python and Kotlin.
I am passionate about the Russian language and Ukraine, playing the yidaki (AKA the didgeridoo) and guitar, science fiction, flying gliders and cross country skiing. Some of my dreams for my future are: I want to work in Antarctica, live in New Zealand, and be involved in a planetary science mission.
