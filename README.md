# Zimri Leisher
I'm a senior CS major at Carleton College who is interested in robotics and aero/astronautics. My primary languages are C++, Python and Kotlin.

## Looking for examples of work?
* [Powerworks](https://www.github.com/zimri-leisher/powerworks) is my biggest project, 19K+ LOC in Kotlin over 5 years. Good example of high-level design in a big project.
* [ArduinoKart](https://github.com/Carleton-Robotics/Arduino-Kart) is the code for an autonomous Arduino-controlled electric cart in C++.
* [n-body simulator](https://github.com/zimri-leisher/n-body-sim) is a GUI and orbital simulator in C++.
* [Shopping list](https://github.com/zimri-leisher/shopping-list) is an Android app in Kotlin.
