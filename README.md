# Zimri Leisher
* I am a master's student at the Unversity of Michigan, working on global climate models.
* Previously, I worked in the space industry at Firefly Aerospace.
* I'm a frequent contributor to the FPrime flight software framework, developed by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
* I develop the Fpy spacecraft sequencing language for FPrime.
* My primary languages are C++, Python and Kotlin.
* I am passionate about the Russian language and Ukraine, playing the yidaki (AKA the didgeridoo) and guitar, science fiction, flying gliders and cross country skiing.
* Some of my dreams for my future are: I want to work in Antarctica, live in New Zealand, and be involved in a planetary science mission.
