# Zimri Leisher
I code rockets at Firefly Aerospace. My primary languages are C++, Python and Kotlin.
I am passionate about the Russian language and Ukraine, playing the yidaki (AKA the didgeridoo), science fiction, and cross country skiing. Some of my dreams for my future are: I want to work in Antarctica, live in New Zealand, and learn how to soar (pilot a glider plane).
